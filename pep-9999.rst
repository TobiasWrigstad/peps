Abstract
========

The PEP proposes an extension to Python with "Behaviour-oriented
Concurrency", a new concurrency model that is safe (in the sense
of no data races) and does not require a GIL.

The PEP extends Python with four new concepts: *behaviours*, *cowns*,
*regions* and *region objects*.

A program's heap is partitioned into isolated regions. Each region
is reified as a region object that allows explicit region
manipulation. Region objects can be wrapped in cowns which allows
them to be shared between "threads", but enforces dynamically that
the contents of a cown is visible to at most one "thread" of
control at a time. Finally, a behaviour is a task that operates on
zero or more acquired cowns.

The isolation of regions ensure that accesses to objects are never
contended.


Proposal
========

Summary:

* Add the new concepts `behaviour`_ and `cown`_
* Add the new concepts `region`_ and `region object`_
* Add a new runtime component for scheduling and running behaviours
* Add new dynamic checking to enforce isolation

The following description first discusses the rationale for
adopting a new concurrency model in Python. The rest of the
description then takes a bottom-up approach. It starts by defining
regions and their reification in Python as region objects, and
operations on region objects. It then defines behaviours and their
reification in Python in form of the ``when`` language construct.


Rationale
---------

Behaviour-oriented Concurrency (BoC for short) is a concurrency
model where programs are comprised of tasks that operate on data.
We call such tasks *behaviours* and partition all mutable data in
a program into isolated *regions*. Each region has a single entry
point that we call a *region object*. That regions are isolated
means that the intersection of any two regions is empty: no
mutable object is reachable from more than one region (with the
exception of region objects).

Unlike e.g. a finish/async model, behaviours do not join at a
particular program point. Such a model encourages a fork/join
style way of building programs, which have a hard time saturating
multicore machines due to Amdahl's law. In BoC, programs
"continue" by behaviours spawning more behaviours, and
coordination happens when behaviours operate on the same regions.

Spawning a behaviour can be likened with an asynchronous method
call to a method that has no return value, and whose arguments are
zero or more cowns each wrapping one region object.

In order to transition from spawned to running, a behaviour needs
to *acquire* all its cowns. (If the behaviour has no parameter, 
it can transition to running immediately.) Acquiring a cown can 
be likened to acquiring a specific lock for the region wrapped 
in the cown. The implementation guarantees that multiple
spawned behaviours whose parameters include the same cowns
will not deadlock, and that only one of the behaviours
will be able to run at a time.

Thus, when a behaviour starts running, it has exclusive access to
all mutable state that it can reach. Therefore, it cannot race
with concurrent behaviours.

When a behaviour finishes, it releases all cowns so that
they can be acquired by other scheduled behaviours.

One of the key advantages of BoC is that it allows happens-before
relations between behaviours to be expressed easily in a readable
way by tying it to program order and how cowns are
chained across behaviours. See `Examples`_.


Regions and Region Objects
--------------------------

A region is a set of mutable objects that are isolated from the
mutable objects in the rest of the program. Isolation means that
an object in a region can only be referenced by objects in the
same region. Every region has a unique *region object* that serves
as the entry point into a region. In addition to references from
the region itself, the region object can have a single incoming
reference from another region.

Let ``region(o)`` be a function that returns the region object for
the region to which ``o`` belongs and ``is_region_obj(r)`` be a
function that returns ``True`` if ``r`` is a region object.
Assuming that all objects are mutable or region objects, the
following function returns ``True``::
  
   def example(o):
     r1 = region(o)
     r2 = region(o.f)     # Assume o.f is defined and not None
     return r1 == r2 or is_region_obj(r2)


Region Isolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Region isolation is enforced by runtime checking. A write to a field
will raise an exception if the object stored in the field belongs to
another region. When called with objects belonging to different
regions, the following function returns ``True``::
  
   def example(o1, o2):
     assert region(o1) != region(o2)
     try:
       o1.f = o2
     except RegionIsolationError:
       return True
     return False


Region Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regions are created by creating a region object::
  
  r = Region("optional name")

This creates a new region which is empty except for the region
object itself. The optional name is used in messages in exceptions
for debugging purposes.

A region has a field ``root`` which points to a single object in
the region. This field is initialised to ``None``.

  **TODO** Do we allow other fields to be created in a region obj?


Opening and Closing Regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regions have two states: *open* and *closed*. Regions are closed
upon creation. When a region is closed, its objects (and `nested
regions`_) are not accessible to the program::
  
  x = r.root         # raises RegionIsolationError
  r.root = object()  # -''-

Regions are opened using the standard ``with`` construct::
  
  r = Region("my region")
  # r is now closed
  with r:
    # r is now open
    x = r.root         # OK, read r's root into stack variable x
    r.root = object()  # OK, store new object in r's root
  # r is now closed again

  **TODO** How should we guard against the following situation?

  ::

    r1 = Region("r1")
    x = None
    with r1:
      r1.root = [42]
      x = r1.root
    print(x[0])  # Accesses object inside closed region

The Current Region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We refer to the most recently opened region as the *current*
region. All allocations take place in the current region. The
following code creates two regions, ``r1`` and ``r2`` and
creates one object in each region::
  
  r1 = Region("r1")
  r2 = Region("r2")
  with r1:
    o1 = object()   # Created in r1
  with r2:
    o2 = object()   # Created in r2

The following code snippet is equivalent to the one above::
  
  r1 = Region("r1")
  r2 = Region("r2")
  with r1:
    o1 = object()    # Created in r1
    with r2:
      o2 = object()  # Created in r2

The difference between the two last examples is that in the
second, ``r1`` and ``r2`` are both open simultaneously on
the line where ``o2`` is created. 

A region can be opened multiple times, so the following code
is legal::

  with r1:
    with r2:
      with r1:
        r1.root = object()

(Note: there is no need to open a region multiple times but allowing
it makes code more compositional.)

.. _nested regions:
.. _nested:

Nesting Regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regions can be nested -- this happens automatically when an
object in a region stores a region object. The following code
creates a region with a list object whose elements are all
region objects::

  r1 = Region("r1")
  with r1:
    r1.root = [Region("r%d") % i for i in range(2,5)]

If region ``r1`` is nested inside region ``r2``, we say that
``r2`` is the (direct) parent or ``r1``. A region that is not
nested inside another is called *independent*. All regions are
created as independent.

Only an independent region may be nested inside another region. An
attempt at nesting a region twice inside the same region or inside
multiple regions will raise a ``NestingException``::

  r1 = Region("r1")
  r2 = Region("r2")
  r3 = Region("r3")
  with r1:
    r1.root = [r3]       # OK, nests r3 in r1
  with r2:
    r2.root = r3         # raises NestingException
  with r1:
    append(r1.root, r3)  # raises NestingException

Changing the nesting topology is possible by first detaching the
region before the second nesting. Detaching a region makes it
independent::
  
  ...
  with r1:
    r1.root = None   # detaches r3 from r1, r3 becomes independent
  with r2:
    r2.root = r3     # OK

Python's swap semantics is supported::

  ...
  with r1:
    with r2:
      r1.root, r2.root = r2.root, r1.root

Opening a nested region is only permitted if its parent region is open.
Thus, the following code leads to a ``NestingException``::

  r1 = Region("r1")
  r2 = Region("r2")
  with r1:
    r1.root = r2  # Nest r2 directly inside r1
  with r2:        # raises a NestingException sinde r1 is closed
    ...           # unreachable code
      
    
Merging Regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A closed region can be *merged* into an open region::
  
  # r1 is an open region, r2 is closed
  x = r2.merge(r1)

The code above *moves* all objects in ``r2`` into ``r1``. The
variable ``x`` holds the contents of ``r2.roots``.

After merging, the ``r2`` region still exists but is empty --
``root`` is ``None`` etc.

Merging a region is *shallow*, meaning that nested regions are
unaffected.

Merging from an open region or into a closed region raises a
``MergeException``.


Freezing Regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A region's entire contents can be turned `immutable`_ by
*freezing* it::

  x = r2.freeze()

Freezing a region is *deep*, meaning that nested regions are also
frozen. Freezing removes all frozen region objects from the
frozen object graph. Consider the following code::

  r2 = Region("r2")
  r3 = Region("r3")
  with r2:
    r2.root = [47, r3]
    with r3:
      r3.root = 11
  x = r2.freeze()

The resulting value in ``x`` is the list ``[47, 11]``, i.e.
``r2``'s root, with the frozen content of the nested region ``r3``
as the second element. As a side-effect of the above, the region
objects ``r2`` and ``r3`` become empty and independent.

Freezing an open region raises a ``FreezeException``.


.. _immutable:

Immutable Objects
-----------------

An immutable object's observable state cannot be changed.
(Unobservable state such as its reference count can change.)
An immutable object may only reference other immutable objects.

All attempts to change an immutable object, e.g. a write to a
field, will raise a ``ImmutabilityException``, and the object will
be left unchanged.


Concurrent Owner
----------------

A concurrent owner (cown for short) is a *resource* that is only 
accessible from within behaviours that have successfully acquired
it. A cown can be acquired by at most one behaviour at a time.

A cown is a thin wrapper around a `region object`_. A cown must be
created from an `independent region`_ (otherwise an
``CownCreationException`` is raised)::

  c = cown(Region("r1"))

A region inside a cown is `nested`_ inside that cown, so cannot be used
to create another cown, or be nested inside some other region while 
it is in the cown.

Cowns can be freely stored in fields without creating a nesting
relation between the region of the object and the region in the cown::

  c = cown(Region("r1"))
  r2 = Region("r2")
  r3 = Region("r3")
  with r2:
    with r3:
      r1.root = c  # OK
      r2.root = c  # OK

A cown's region can be accessed in two ways: *moving* and *borrowing*::

  r1 = c.move()
  r2 = c.borrow()

As the names imply, moving takes a region out of the cown whereas
borrowing keeps a region in the cown. Taking a region out of a cown
detaches it from the cown, and makes the region independent. This
allows the region to be nested in another region, used to create 
another cown, etc. 

A cown's region can be updated by the method ``install()``::

  r = Region("r")
  c.install(r)

Calls to ``move()``, ``borrow()`` or ``install()`` on a cown that is
not acquired by the current behaviour raises a ``CownNotAcquiredException``.


Behaviours
----------

A behaviour can be thought of as a task with a set of cowns that must
be acquired by the runtime before the task can run. A behaviour
has no return value.

We refer to behaviours whose cown sets are overlapping as *overlapping
behaviours*. The runtime guarantees that overlapping behaviours are
serialised. 

Behaviours are created (we say spawned) using a new syntactic construct
called ``when``. The following code example spawns a behaviour that 
must acquire the cown ``c1`` to run (this is handled automatically 
by the runtime)::

  when (c1):
    r = c1.borrow()
    with r:
      ...

The following code spawns a behaviour that swaps the contents of two
cowns::

  when (c1, c2):
    r1, r2 = c1.move(), c2.move()
    c2.install(r1)
    c1.install(r2)


Ordering Behaviours
-------------------

The program order of spawns of overlapping behaviours controls the 
happens-before relation between them. In the following example, 
behaviour *b1* is guaranteed to run before *b2* but not before *b3*::

  when (c1, c2):   # b1
    ... 

  when (c2):       # b2
    ...

  when (c3):       # b3
    ...

To ensure that *b3* does not run before *b1*, we can either introduce
a temporary cown to make them overlapping::

  c4 = cown()          # Empty cown
  when (c1, c2, c4):   # b1
    ... 

  when (c2):           # b2 -- can run as soon as b1 finishes
    ...

  when (c3, c4):       # b3 -- can run as soon as b1 finishes
    ...


or we can spawn *b3* at the end of *b1*::

  when (c1, c2):   # b1
    ... 
    when (c3):     # b3
      ...

  when (c2):       # b2
    ...

Note that program order refers to order of execution in a single 
behaviour. In the following case, *b2* may run before or after *b4*::

  c = cown(Region("r"))
  when ():     # b1
    when (c1): # b2
      ...

  when ():     # b3
    when (c1): # b4
      ...

Open Questions
==============

- What is the semantics of opening? order? nesting?
- How do we ensure that an object isn't stored in a local variable whose lifetime is longer than the open-scope of its region?
- Merging, freezing and nesting is sound because we only allow a region object to be referenced from one field
- Can an immutable object have a mutable class?
